## About Me

I'm a final-year B.Tech Computer Science student with a strong foundation in **systems programming**, **operating system design**, and **applied machine learning**. My work spans from writing **bare-metal kernels** to building **compiler toolchains** and deploying **AI-driven applications**.

What sets me apart is the ability to move between low-level systems and high-level ML frameworks — a duality that helps me build **efficient**, **scalable**, and **deeply engineered software systems**.

## Core Competencies

- **Systems Programming**: OS kernels, memory allocators, bootloaders, and custom compilers.
- **AI & Machine Learning**: Neural networks, NLP pipelines, real-time face recognition.
- **Software Architecture**: Modular design, automated build systems, cloud-native workflows.
- **Team Leadership**: Guided academic teams through semester-long Agile-driven projects.

## Selected Projects

### 🧠 GraphOS — 32-bit Bare-Metal Operating System  
> `C`, `x86 Assembly`, `QEMU`, `Makefile`  
A monolithic Ring-0 kernel with a custom shell, memory allocator, and cryptographic utilities. Designed for performance and educational clarity. Includes SHA-224/256, heap management, and QEMU-based automation.

---

### ⚙️ WH Compiler — Custom Compiler for Educational Language  
> `C`, `NASM`, `x86-64`  
Built a compiler with lexical, syntax, and semantic analysis using N-ary AST construction. Outputs optimized NASM assembly. Includes detailed error handling and register-efficient code generation.

---

### 💬 NLP Chatbot — AI-Powered Neural Conversational Agent  
> `Python`, `TensorFlow`, `TFLearn`  
Developed a domain-specific chatbot with deep NLP preprocessing and neural training. Focused on accuracy and contextual response relevance using Lancaster stemming and bag-of-words tokenization.

---

### 🎯 Face Recognition — Real-Time Biometric Identification  
> `OpenCV`, `Dlib`, `face_recognition`, `NumPy`  
High-performance face recognition using ResNet embeddings and Euclidean distance classification. Supports live camera feeds and dynamic face database updates.

---

### 📚 Library Management System (GUI + DB)  
> `C++`, `Qt`, `SQLite`  
Cross-platform desktop application with complete CRUD functionality and role-based access. Built using Qt Widgets with lightweight SQL backend.
