👨‍💻 About Me
I'm a final-year Computer Science student at Graphic Era University. I'm fascinated by what happens under the hood of a computer. My main interests are:

⚙️ Low-Level & Systems Programming: I love getting my hands dirty with C, assembly, and memory management. I've built things like bootloaders and even a tiny OS from scratch.

🔧 Compiler Design: Curious about how code turns into magic, so I built my own compiler that takes a custom language and spits out x86-64 assembly.

🧠 AI & Machine Learning: I also enjoy building intelligent systems, from NLP chatbots to real-time computer vision apps.

At the end of the day, I just love solving complex problems and making my code as fast and efficient as possible.

🚀 My Projects
Here's some of the stuff I've been working on.

Project

Tech Stack

What's Cool About It?

GraphOS 🧬

C, x86, QEMU, Makefile

Wrote a 32-bit OS from scratch. It's got a basic shell, heap memory, and even crypto functions. No big deal 😉.

Custom Compiler 🔧

C, NASM, x86-64

Built a whole compiler pipeline: Lexer → Parser (AST) → Assembly Generator. Super fun project.

Chatbot AI 💬

TensorFlow, TFLearn, NLP

A simple NLP chatbot using TensorFlow. It understands what you're saying (most of the time).

Face Recognition 👁️

OpenCV, Dlib, NumPy

Real-time face recognition using OpenCV and Dlib. It can pick a face out of a crowd.

Big Integer Library 📐

C

Needed to handle huge numbers in C for competitive programming, so I wrote my own BigInt library.

Library System GUI 📚

C++, Qt, SQLite

A classic library management system, but with a neat desktop GUI made with C++ and Qt.

...and more over in the Repositories tab!

🏆 A Few Accomplishments
Led a couple of project teams for my university's Project-Based Learning courses.

Scored 100/100 in Science in the Class 10 CBSE exams (Top 0.1% National Merit Holder).

Got a few certifications along the way in AI Fundamentals and Azure.
